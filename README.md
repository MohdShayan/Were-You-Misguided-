# Vite React Project: Khul Ja Sim Sim

This project is a simple React app that demonstrates a magical "Khul Ja Sim Sim" door animation with a button click. The door parts animate as they move to reveal a hidden message. This app uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development and hot module reloading.

## About Vite

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a modern build tool and development environment for web projects. It provides an incredibly fast and efficient development experience. Vite focuses on optimizing the development process by leveraging modern JavaScript features, such as ES Modules (ESM), to deliver faster hot module reloading (HMR) and instant server start. Vite comes with built-in support for React, TypeScript, and other popular frameworks, which allows you to easily set up your project with minimal configuration.

Some features of Vite:

- **Fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Vite provides nearly instantaneous updates without losing state in your app.
- **Faster builds**: Vite uses a new approach to bundling and optimizing code, reducing build times significantly compared to older tools like Webpack.
- **Optimized for modern browsers**: Vite uses ESBuild under the hood, allowing you to take advantage of cutting-edge browser features and run your app in a fast and optimized manner.
