## About Vite

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a modern build tool and development environment for web projects. It provides an incredibly fast and efficient development experience. Vite focuses on optimizing the development process by leveraging modern JavaScript features, such as ES Modules (ESM), to deliver faster hot module reloading (HMR) and instant server start. Vite comes with built-in support for React, TypeScript, and other popular frameworks, which allows you to easily set up your project with minimal configuration.

Some features of Vite:

- **Fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Vite provides nearly instantaneous updates without losing state in your app.
- **Faster builds**: Vite uses a new approach to bundling and optimizing code, reducing build times significantly compared to older tools like Webpack.
- **Optimized for modern browsers**: Vite uses ESBuild under the hood, allowing you to take advantage of cutting-edge browser features and run your app in a fast and optimized manner.

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites

## The Story of "Khul Ja Sim Sim" Door
In a distant land, nestled among towering mountains and lush forests, there stood a legendary door. This was no ordinary door — it was the magical Khul Ja Sim Sim door. It was said to have the power to open and reveal wondrous things, but only when the right words were spoken.

The door was part of an ancient temple that had been lost to time. Scholars and adventurers tried for centuries to unlock its secrets, but no one succeeded. The door had a unique feature: it could only be opened when the phrase "Khul Ja Sim Sim" was uttered with great conviction. It was believed that this phrase was passed down from an ancient civilization, the Simvani, who were the first to harness the magic of this powerful door.

One day, a curious traveler named Rohan stumbled upon the long-forgotten ruins while exploring the mountains. He had heard stories of the door and its mythical properties, and he couldn't resist the temptation to see it for himself. As he approached the door, he noticed the faint symbols etched along its frame. There was an inscription, half-erased by the ravages of time, but still readable:

"Only the brave will witness the power, for the door only opens with the words of the ancients: Khul Ja Sim Sim."


Rohan stood there for a moment, contemplating. What could these words mean? What kind of magic was tied to this door? He had heard legends, but he never expected to stand before it himself. He closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and recited the words from the inscription:

"Khul Ja Sim Sim!"

To his surprise, the ground beneath him trembled slightly, and the door began to hum with energy. The ancient wood creaked, and a bright light emanated from its center. Slowly, the door parted down the middle, revealing a breathtaking sight: a hidden chamber filled with sparkling treasures, ancient scrolls, and artifacts beyond imagination.

But what was even more astonishing was what lay at the heart of the chamber — a crystal that glowed with an otherworldly light. It was said to hold the knowledge of the Simvani, their culture, their magic, and their most profound secrets. The Khul Ja Sim Sim door had not only revealed riches but also unlocked an ancient legacy that had been forgotten for generations.

Rohan stepped inside, knowing that he had just become part of an incredible story. And as the door closed behind him, he understood that the magic of Khul Ja Sim Sim was not just in its power to reveal things — but in its ability to guide those who truly sought wisdom.
